Dry bean (XAI)
This project focuses on dry bean classification using soft voting classifiers of DT, RF, XGB, Cat boost, and LGBM algorithms and 
compares the performance of each algorithm. Finally, we have selected the best classifiers and developed an explainable and interpretable model to enhance trust in the algorithms. The aim of the explainable and interpretable is to solve the black-box nature of the algorithms.
